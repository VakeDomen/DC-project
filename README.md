# DC-project
This is a project for Distributed computing class. It is a sticky notes web application. 
# Application requirements
## Functional requirements

## Techincal requirements
This aplication requires a database to store the data of the notes somewhere. Since we want miltiple users to be able to use the application seperatly, authentication is required. 

# Study of existing frameworks
Comparisson of tools used for the develovpment of the project

## Backend
| Language/Framework | Speed | Small overhead | Compiled | Familarity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> |
| Java | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> |
| NodeJS | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> |

Even with the develovpment overhead that comes with rust programming language, it has been chosen for backend due to the speed that it provides. Rustâ€™s type system and ownership model also guarantee memory and thread safety.

## Frontend
| Language/Framework | Performance |  Size | Provided utilities | Familarity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Angular8 | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> |
| React | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |
| Vue | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [x] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> | <ul><li>- [ ] </li></ul> |

Due to the fimilarity with the framework, Angular 8 has been chosen for develovpent of the frontend.

# Application architecture

# Techincal choices
Since the application is small SQLite database was chosen, due to it being lightweight. For ORM the aplication uses [diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) since it provides a good support to SQLite. Diesel gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates runtime errors without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder. For authentication (password hashing and user verification) the application uses [argonautica](https://github.com/bcmyers/argonautica) that is a Rust crate for hashing passwords using the cryptographically-secure Argon2 hashing algorithm.
